## How to Create Combinations

1. **Match to create power-ups** - Make matches of 4+ gems or special patterns
2. **Swap two power-ups** - Drag one power-up onto another adjacent power-up
3. **Watch the combo!** - The combined effect triggers immediately

## Strategic Tips

- **Color Bomb + Color Bomb** is the most powerful combination - save it for tough situations
- **Rocket combinations** are great for clearing large sections quickly
- **TNT + TNT** creates the largest single explosion
- **Fly-Away combinations** are excellent for targeting hard-to-reach areas
