user should get points for all blow ups even if from a power ups
the rockets should be more exciting maybe blowing up each jewel as it goes by?
there should be a pwer up for 3x2 or 2x3 right? we need to make sure the best power up is given first
if 2 fly aways go off they shouldn't target the same jewel
It would be cool to see how you compare score wise as well as during the game it would be intersting to see how you've done against yourself and others some way visually right?
for fly away power ups if the match is made from the right the power up should end up in the lower right spot. If the matchis made from the left the power up whould be lower right.
Bombs should include the corner jewels
